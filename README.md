# MATLAB-Signal-Processing
Developed and implemented various signal processing techniques using MATLAB, including waveform generation (sawtooth, triangular, rectangular), sinusoidal signal addition, correlation (auto and cross), circular convolution, Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and Inverse DFT (IDFT), amplitude modulation and demodulation, and single-sideband (SSB) modulation. Utilized MATLAB functions like plot(), stem(), xcorr(), fft(), and ifft() to analyze and manipulate signals. Gained hands-on experience in signal analysis, transformation, and filtering techniques.
